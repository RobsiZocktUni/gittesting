- Maby the MC is the actual bad Guy
- Players can think they know right from wrong, but then they learn their thinking is bias because of the narriator
- Showing that the perspective of who tells the story might influence what others think

- person 1 and 2 might also have a connection to eachother from the past

- the Villan could also be a psychopath who sees the world as his personal Playground, or the Villain could see themselves as God

- Information about the previous inhabitants of the House can be found + they may or may not be connected to it all
