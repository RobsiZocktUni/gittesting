english as the general language to use while working on this project


## General:
- Escape room as basic element
-> Puzzles
- 3D first person view
- camera is movable
- Psycho horror 
-> feeling of being followed/observed
- Low poly and/or pixel optics (8 or 16bit filter?)

## Gameplay
- Movement through 3D environment
-> simple controls and understanding of the basic mechanics
- Control with mouse and keyboard (no controller support planned)
- Interaction with items/objects by mouse click
- Joining objects together
- Puzzle mechanics controllable by mouse and keyboard (WASD and numbers)
- inside system, things / objects etc change by finding items

## gameloop
### stormed ideas
- without fighting
- feeling of being chased
- no existing opponents
- things can fly around
- few jumpscares
### jumpscares
- enter room -> appearance of e.g. scratch marks, blood, for no reason
## story
- human develops virus, wants to wipe out humanity
- strange doll that talks (find individual parts)(pot puzzle)
- escape is only a side story
- enter house by day, becomes phmmighty, house completely wreathed, etc
- no story telling planed as of now
- if story idea, everyone contributes -> by exclusion then what remains in the game

## Location & scenery:
- potential upgrading to an entire house house
- Old “abandoned” house/apartment in the middle of nowhere (floor plan or first impression exists)
- Actually old/creepy scenery with modern aspects
 -> e.g. random PC with documents about the property
- creepy aspects can be created by the surroundings and inexplicable circumstances
- winding rooms, narrow, labyrinth-like corridors (contrasts large room)
- viewloading / pos detect to change rooms
- room upside down
