# Important talkpoints:

- Meeting plan day? (Hennis favourite: monday, so we have a week for coding/planning until next lecture; also a full normal week)
- Distribution of roles (who works on puzzles)  
=> planned:  
Jasi: Art and modelling   
Franziska: modelling  
Jonas: programming; inventory, 2D movement, (enemy coding)  
Lena: programming; event scripting, lightning; maybe story  
Henni: project management; programming; character movement, character interaction; maybe story  

- first steps in Unity are not for the final product, so we can try stuff


## Game talkpoints
=> Gameloop/GDD  
=> "fixed" ideas so we can start working  
=> ideas from Jasmin (powerpoing) and Lena (skript)  
=> for past ideas: Github Talkpoints (9.10.24)
- story
- enemies (yes or no?)
- Location/scenerie
- rooms
- puzzles
- jumpscares (psychological)
